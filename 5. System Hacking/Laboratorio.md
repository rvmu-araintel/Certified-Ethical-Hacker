Bypassing access controls to gain access to the system (such as password cracking and vulnerability exploitation)
Acquiring the rights of another user or an admin (privilege escalation)
Creating and maintaining remote access to the system (executing applications such as trojans, spyware, backdoors, and keyloggers)
Hiding malicious activities and data theft (executing applications such as Rootkits, steganography, etc.)
Hiding the evidence of compromise (clearing logs)


Gaining Access: Use techniques such as cracking passwords and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system

Escalating Privileges: Exploit known vulnerabilities existing in OSes and software applications to escalate privileges

Maintaining Access: Maintain high levels of access to perform malicious activities such as executing malicious applications and stealing, hiding, or tampering with sensitive system files

Clearing Logs: Avoid recognition by legitimate system users and remain undetected by wiping out the entries corresponding to malicious activities in the system logs, thus avoiding detection.


Ethical hackers or pen testers use numerous tools and techniques to hack the target systems. Recommended labs that will assist you in learning various system hacking techniques include:

Gain access to the system

Perform active online attack to crack the system’s password using Responder
Audit system passwords using L0phtCrack
Find vulnerabilities on exploit sites
Exploit client-side vulnerabilities and establish a VNC session
Gain access to a remote system using Armitage
Gain access to a remote system using Ninja Jonin
Perform buffer overflow attack to gain access to a remote system
Perform privilege escalation to gain higher privileges

Escalate privileges using privilege escalation tools and exploit client-side vulnerabilities
Hack a Windows machine using Metasploit and perform post-exploitation using Meterpreter
Escalate privileges by exploiting vulnerability in pkexec
Escalate privileges in Linux machine by exploiting misconfigured NFS
Escalate privileges by bypassing UAC and exploiting Sticky Keys
Escalate privileges to gather hashdump using Mimikatz
Maintain remote access and hide malicious activities

User system monitoring and surveillance using Power Spy
User system monitoring and surveillance using Spytech SpyAgent
Hide files using NTFS streams
Hide data using white space steganography
Image steganography using OpenStego and StegOnline
Maintain persistence by abusing boot or logon autostart execution
Maintain domain persistence by exploiting Active Directory Objects
Privilege escalation and maintain persistence using WMI
Covert channels using Covert_TCP
Clear logs to hide the evidence of compromise

View, enable, and clear audit policies using Auditpol
