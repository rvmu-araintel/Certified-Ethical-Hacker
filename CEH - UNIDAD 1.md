<h1>UNIDAD 1</h1>

Un ataque es la suma de un motivo, un método y una vulnerabilidad.

Debemos tener claros los elementos de la seguridad de la información:
Confidencialidad, Integridad, Disponibilidad, Autenticidad y No Repudio.

Se clasifican cinco tipos de ataques:
Pasivos, activos, de cercanía, desde dentro, o por distribuición. 

La guerra informática (Infowar) es el uso de cualquier tipo de tecnología para tener 
ventaja competitiva sobre el oponente.

Diferenciamos según Libicki:
Command and Control (C2) (impact an attacker possesses over a compromised system or network).
Intelligence-based (design, protection, and denial of systems that seek sufficient knowledge to 
dominate the battlespace).
Eelectronic warfare (radio-electronic and cryptographic techniques).
Psycological warfare (propaganda and terror to demoralize one’s adversary).
Hacker Warfare (can vary from the shutdown of systems, data errors, theft of information).
Economic Warfare (affect the economy of a business or nation)
Cyberwarfare (use of information systems against the virtual personas of individuals or groups. It is 
the broadest of all information warfare).

Debemos conocer la metdología hacking del CEH (CHM):
1. Footprinting
2. Scanning
3. Enumertion
4. Vulnerability Analysis
5. System Hacking
  5.1 Gaining Access (Cracking passwords and vulnerability exploiting)
  5.2 Escalating Privileges
  5.3 Maintaining Access (Executing applications and hidding files)
  5.4 Clearing logs (Covering Tracks)

También el Cyber Kill Chain Metodology:
Component of intelligence-driven defense for the identification and prevention of malicious 
intrusion activities.
1. Reconnoissance
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. C2
7. Actions on Objectives

También los patrones TTPs, Técnicas, tácticas y procedimientos:
“Tactics” is defined as a guideline that describes the way an attacker performs their attack 
from beginning to end, “techniques” is defined as the technical methods used by an attacker and 
“procedures” is defined as the organizational approach followed by the threat actors to launch 
their attack.

Identificación del adversario:
Identification of the common methods or techniques followed by an adversary to launch attacks.
1. Internal Reconnoissance
2. Use PoerShell
3. Unspecified Proxy Activities
4. Use of Command-Line Interface
5. HTTP User A
6. Command and Control Server
7. Use of DNS Tunneling
8. Use of Web Shell
9. Data Staging

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):
A good source of information about threats that serve as data points in the intelligence process.
1. Email Indicators
2. Network Indicators
3. Host-Based Indicators
4. Behavioral Indicators
 ▪ Unusual outbound network traffic 
 ▪ Unusual activity through a privileged user account 
 ▪ Geographical anomalies 
 ▪ Multiple login failures
 ▪ Increased database read volume 
 ▪ Large HTML response size 
 ▪ Multiple requests for the same file 
 ▪ Mismatched port-application traffic 
 ▪ Suspicious registry or system file changes 
 ▪ Unusual DNS requests 
 ▪ Unexpected patching of systems

Otro método o framework de trabajo es el MITRE ATT&CK Framework:
A globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world 
observations.

MITRE ATT&CK comprises three collections of tactics and techniques, called Enterprise, Mobile, 
and PRE-ATT&CK matrices, as each collection is represented in a matrix form. ATT&CK for Enterprise 
contains 14 categories of tactics, which are derived from the later stages (exploit, control, maintain,
and execute) of the seven-stage Cyber Kill Chain. This provides a deeper level of granularity in 
describing what can occur during an intrusion.

¿Pero qué es el Hacking Ético?:
The practice of employing computer and network skills in order to assist organizations in testing their
network security for possible loopholes and vulnerabilities. Diferenciar hacker, hackear y crackear.
The important distinction between ethical hackers and crackers is consent. Crackers attempt to gain 
unauthorized access to systems, while ethical hackers are always completely open and transparent about 
what they are doing and how they are doing it. Ethical hacking is, therefore, always legal.

Tiger Team:
Ethical hackers determine the scope of the security assessment according to the client’s security 
concerns. Many ethical hackers are members of a “Tiger Team.” A tiger team works together to perform 
a full-scale test covering all aspects of the network, as well as physical and system intrusion. 

Information Assurance:
IA refers to the assurance that the integrity, availability, confidentiality, and authenticity of 
information and information systems is protected during the usage, processing, storage, and transmission
of information.

Continual/Adaptive Security Strategy:
 adaptive security strategy, which involves implementing all the four network security approaches
❑ The adaptive security strategy consists of four security activities corresponding to each security 
approach, Protect, Detect, Respond, Predict. 

Defense-in-Depth:
Several protection layers are placed throughout an information system.

Riesgo:
The degree of uncertainty or expectation of potential damage that an adverse event may cause to the 
system or its resources, under specified conditions.
RISK = Threats x Vulnerabilities x Impact
RISK = Threat × Vulnerability × Asset Value
The probability of the occurrence of an adverse event 
The consequence of the adverse event
