Lab 1: Perform DoS and DDoS Attacks using Various Techniques


In general, the following are categories of DoS/DDoS attack vectors:

Volumetric Attacks: Consume the bandwidth of the target network or service

Attack techniques:

UDP flood attack
ICMP flood attack
Ping of Death and smurf attack
Pulse wave and zero-day attack
Protocol Attacks: Consume resources like connection state tables present in the network infrastructure components such as load-balancers, firewalls, and application servers

SYN flood attack
Fragmentation attack
Spoofed session floodâ€¯attack
ACK flood attack
Application Layer Attacks: Consume application resources or services, thereby making them unavailable to other legitimate users

Attack techniques:

HTTP GET/POST attack
Slowloris attack
UDP application layer flood attack
DDoS extortion attack
