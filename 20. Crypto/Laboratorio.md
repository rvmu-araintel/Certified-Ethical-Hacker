creating and using a self-signed certificate.

Digital Signature: Uses asymmetric cryptography to simulate the security properties of a signature in digital, rather than written form
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): Uses RSA asymmetric (public key) encryption to encrypt data transferred over SSL connections
Transport Layer Security (TLS): Uses a symmetric key for bulk encryption, an asymmetric key for authentication and key exchange, and message authentication codes for message integrity
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP): Used to encrypt and decrypt data that provides authentication and cryptographic privacy
GNU Privacy Guard (GPG): Software replacement of PGP and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard that is used to encrypt and decrypt data
