Understanding when and how web applications connect to a database server in order to access data
Performing a SQL injection attack on a MSSQL database
Extracting basic SQL injection flaws and vulnerabilities
Detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities

In-band SQL injection: An attacker uses the same communication channel to perform the attack and retrieve the results
Blind/inferential SQL injection: An attacker has no error messages from the system with which to work, but rather simply sends a malicious SQL query to the database
Out-of-band SQL injection: An attacker uses different communication channels (such as database email functionality, or file writing and loading functions) to perform the attack and obtain the resu

SQL injection can be used to implement the following attacks:

Authentication bypass: An attacker logs onto an application without providing a valid username and password and gains administrative privileges
Authorization bypass: An attacker alters authorization information stored in the database by exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities
Information disclosure: An attacker obtains sensitive information that is stored in the database
Compromised data integrity: An attacker defaces a webpage, inserts malicious content into webpages, or alters the contents of a database
Compromised availability of data: An attacker deletes specific information, the log, or audit information in a database
Remote code execution: An attacker executes a piece of code remotely that can compromise the host OS
